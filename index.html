            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Rodel Rodriguez Jr. I’m a student of Notre Dame of Kidapawan College, and I want to get into the field of computers.

I’ve been working on my portfolio since high school, but now it’s time to show the world what I’ve got. And that’s why I’ve created this website—so you can see my work so far and get a sense of who I am.</p>
        I'm 22 years old. I live in  Singao, Kidapawan City. I graduated High School at Kidapawan City National High School.

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>I have a small and happy family. We live in a small house in Singao. There are five members in our family. My parents, my younger sister, younger brother and me. My father Rodel T. Rodriguez is a farmer. He takes care of our necessities. My mother is a teacher. They teach us good manners and discipline. They really work hard to secure our future. We all have deep respect and love for each other. I am very lucky to have a family like this.</p>

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Basketball is my favorite hobby of all time! I got involved in basketball because i was interested in the sport. Basketball is a great way of exercise and a great way to have fun with friends and possibly make some new ones.</p>
        <p>Music is My Hobby
Everybody has his or her own hobby. My second hobby is playing music and of course, listens to music as well. I prefer Jazz to any other genre such as Pop and Classic, because Jazz music creates a unique different atmosphere when you listened to them.
 It gives you the feeling of relaxation and has many unexpected tunes that actually very nice to hear from a song, which made me interested and curious to learn it. My love of music began in the first year of my elementary school. Of all musical instruments that exist, I was most interested to guitar.</p>
